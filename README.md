## Curriculum

### Week 1-2
#### Assignment 1: Hello, World!
1. Install the Rust SDK: https://www.rust-lang.org/en-US/
2. Write, compile and run a 'Hello, World!' program

#### Assignment 2: Fibonacci Sequence generator
1. Write a program `fib(n)` that takes an input integer `n` and returns the n'th fibonacci number. E.g., the 7th fibonacci number is 13 (1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13), so `fib(7)` should return 13. For bonus points experiment with different implementations of the algorithm (recursive, iterative, etc.)
